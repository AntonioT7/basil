**tdc** - time to digital converter
=====================================

Simple time to digital converter. Can digitalize input pulse with and distance between 2 pulses (ex. trigger and hit).
Calculated values are propagated to FIFO data interface.

Use `BROADCAST` parameter in order to share fast (640 MHz sampled) trigger signal with other tdc modules.
